## Description

## Installation

This repo can be downloaded from the Releases tab to the right, or by running `git clone <repo URL>` if you have git commanline installed.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in the web browser of your choice.

The page contains some information on the main technologies used on the web. Opening the Javascript console gives you a topic to study, and a maze to solve.
